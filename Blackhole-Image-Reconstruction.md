# Blackhole Image/Video Reconstruction

Keypoints are
- Inputs are not image pixels, but frequency domain data.
- Input data has time delays due to attenuation factors of the telescopes.
- Telescopes located at different spherical points have different sensitivity to certain frequencies.

## Proof of concept

- 4 core teams of researchers work independently to produce
